#2019-05-01
	working on parameterizing my project for user specified h5 file (only works for ulf's).
	might abandon zfp due to poor compression ratio for 1d arrays. Zfp_job will no longer work.
	I will need to update parse_output and plot_results to reflect this change.
	BUG: The plot labels are not displaying the correct mode, I will need to investigate this.
